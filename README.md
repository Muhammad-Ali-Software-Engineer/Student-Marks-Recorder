# Student Marks Recorder – Mini Python Project

**Student Marks Recorder** is a **mini Python project** designed to manage student records efficiently with **file handling** for persistent storage. It allows users to **store student names and marks**, view all records, delete entries, and perform basic analysis like finding **highest, lowest, and average marks**. All data is saved in a text file (`students.txt`), so your records are maintained even after closing the program.
